  description: 'Hemomancers are manipulators of their own blood.

    Their magic
    causes those hit to be infected with "blood curse", this magic however causes
    them to lose their own health to cast it. Hitting those afflicted with a basic
    attack or other vocation skill causes the bloodcurse to pop dealing damage and
    healing them.


    //Only one instance of blookcurse can be on a opponent at
    once.

    //As a passive convert bonus health to pwr and bonus pwr to health,
    this does not stack on itself.

    //Magic will of course focus on red

    //Maybe
    give a cool mark on the hand of those who use hemomancy'
